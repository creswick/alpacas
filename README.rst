A Library for Programming A Client And Server
==================================================

ALPACAS is a Web server that can reload itself, XMonad-style, and has
the ability to write its own configuration file. The idea is that it
will be a development environment that's inherently extensible, like
emacs, except using a modern platform (the Web).

It's currently pre-alpha, so you'll likely have to hack the code to
get it to run at all. Look for documentation on the Hackage package
dyre to get started with customizing it.

See TODO for what's coming next.
